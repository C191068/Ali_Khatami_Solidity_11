### Libraries

In order to make the math of the contract at this link https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Solidity_10.git easier <br>
we need to introduce the concept of library<br>

https://solidity-by-example.org/ is an important documentation for solidity<br>

Libraries are similar to contracts, but we can't declare any state variable and we can't send ether.<br>

We can also use libraries to add more functionality to different values <br>
